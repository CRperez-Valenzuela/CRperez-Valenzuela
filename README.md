🛠️ Projects
ShopSport Sneakers' E-commerce ()

An intuitive web application (currently not responsive) designed for an e-commerce platform, built using a robust stack of technologies including React, Redux, Styled Components, Sequelize, Node.js, Express, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The development process was managed with Scrum methodology and versioned using Git.

The application features an admin panel for managing products, users, sales analytics, and real-time chat, leveraging Cloudinary for image storage and Docker for containerization. Additionally, it includes a user panel for purchase history, favorites, and personal information.

The backend is powered by Sequelize with SQL databases managed through pgAdmin and Excel for data analysis. It also integrates email notifications via Axios, third-party authentication, and a payment gateway (Mercado Pago).

This project is the final assignment from Henry Academy, completed in collaboration with three other bootcamp peers. It was developed and tested in a Windows environment, ensuring compatibility across different platforms.

Countries ()

This individual project was developed to apply the skills learned during the Henry bootcamp, using technologies limited to those required for completion, such as React, Redux, Styled Components, Sequelize, Node, and pgAdmin. The application features a simple country search functionality, where users can view a card displaying the country’s details along with its flag. Additionally, there is a form to create new tourist activities associated with the selected country, considering factors like difficulty and the appropriate season for the activity. The application also includes combined filters, pagination, and other features that enhance its usability and visual appeal.
